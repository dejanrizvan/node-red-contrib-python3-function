Python 3 Function NodeRED Node
=============================

Extension of original package from Arrnau Orriols
https://github.com/arnauorriols/node-red-contrib-python-function


Install
-------
Python 2.7 and Python 3.x compatible

`npm install -g node-red-contrib-python3-function`

Usage
-----

Just like the plain-old function node, but writing Python instead of Javascript.
The msg is a dictionary, (almost) all the Node-RED helper functions are available, and its behavior
 is expected to be exactly the same (at some point in the future at least).
